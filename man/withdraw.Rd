\arguments{
\item{CELL_withdrawal_m3}{Vector of withdrawal requirements in cubic meters.
This represents water demand and will be updated to reflect remaining deficit.}

\item{CELL_water_m3}{Vector of available water volumes in cubic meters.
This will be updated to reflect remaining water after withdrawal.}

\item{CELL_cellNumberAround_int}{Matrix of cell indices that define surrounding cells.
Each column corresponds to a cell, with rows containing indices of surrounding cells.}

\item{CELL_cellNumberWithdrawNet_int}{Matrix defining the withdrawal network.
Each column corresponds to a cell, with rows containing indices of cells
from which water can be withdrawn in order of priority.}

\description{
[withdraw_SingleCell] This function handles water withdrawal from a single cell's water storage.
It updates the withdrawal deficit and the remaining water volume.
