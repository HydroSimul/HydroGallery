\value{
A field of uvecs containing the inflow cells for each cell.

NULL (invisible)

An integer vector of cells in the intersection of the station cells and the basin.

An integer vector representing the new upstream basin, which includes the upstream cells and the set difference of the basin cells.
This function identifies the upstream basin of a given outlet cell by first finding the intersection of the upstream cells
with the cells that flow into the outlet. It then computes the set difference between the upstream basin and the outlet basin.

An integer vector of the new outflow indices adjusted for the sub-basin.

A list of integer vectors (`lst_Step_Cali`), where each element represents calibration cells at a specific step.

A list of integer vectors (`lst_Step_Cali`), where each element represents calibration cells at a specific step.
}
\description{
This function calculates inflow cells based on the outflow vector.

Creates a matrix of inflow cells for each cell.

Creates a list of inflow cells for each step.

Creates a field of last cells for each step.
